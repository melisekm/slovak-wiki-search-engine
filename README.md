- Preprocess text with NLP, normalize, tokenize, remove stopwords, POS tagging, lemmatization.

## Structure

Program is separated to three parts.
1. Custom implementation of preprocessing and indexing. (slovak_wiki_search_engine) - not dockerized
2. Spark distributed implementation of preprocessing. (spark) - dockerized
3. PyLucene implementation of indexing and searching. (pylucene) - dockerized
